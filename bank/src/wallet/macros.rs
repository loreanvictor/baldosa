///
/// A macro for committing a set transactions to the ledger, storing
/// them into the database. The macro will return an array of persisted
/// transactions (with generated transaction ids).
///
/// This macro can only be invoked in `async` contexts, and will
/// await the completion of the database transaction. All transactions
/// will be committed via a single insert query for efficiency.
///
/// ### Example:
/// ```rs
/// let [tx1, tx2] = commit_transactions!(ledger; tx1, tx2)?;
/// ```
/// Or with error handling:
/// ```rs
/// match commit_transactions!(ledger; tx1, tx2) {
///   Ok([tx1, tx2]) => { ... },
///   Err(_) => { ... },
/// }
/// ```
/// ### Returns:
/// `Result<[Transaction; N], sqlx::Error>`, when given `N` transactions.
///

///
/// A macro for creating a transaction.
///
/// ### Usage:
/// #### Initializing an Account:
/// ğŸ‘‰ initialize an account with given initial value:
/// ```rs
/// tx! { => account; using 10; by issuer }
/// ```
/// - account is an `Account`,
/// - issuer is an `AuthenticatedUser`.
/// ---
/// #### Transferring Money:
/// ğŸ‘‰ spend a transaction to offer money from some sender to some receiver:
/// ```rs
/// tx! { sender => receiver; using consumed, amount; by issuer }
/// tx! { sender => receiver; using consumed, amount; by issuer, note }
/// ```
/// - sender and receiver are `Account`s,
/// - consumed is of type `Transaction`,
/// - issuer is an `AuthenticatedUser`.
/// ---
/// #### Merging Transactions:
/// ğŸ‘‰ merge a transaction into a user's state:
/// ```rs
/// tx! { merge consumed => state; by issuer }
/// tx! { merge consumed => state; using amount; by issuer }
/// ```
/// - consumed and state are `Transaction`s,
/// - issuer is an `AuthenticatedUser`.
///
