**Baldosa** is an infinite community-driven canvas, where tiles are submitted by the community,
and selected through an auction process.

* Baldosa is a static, shared, infinite grid.
* Each tile of the grid can have an image, title, description, and an arbitrary URL.
* Anyone can bid on a tile, proposing its content.
* An auction is held for each tile, where the highest bid determines the content.
* The content of the tile remains for a day, until the next auction.

## Why?

Logically? no reason at all. Think of it as a weird experiment.

But honestly? Because I am tired of algorithms soullessly grouping content together and
using those groupings to create isolated, subjective, "personalised" bubbles, keeping us locked within.
Baldosa is supposed to be the polar opposite: a non-personal, objective, shared canvas, where the community
decides which content belongs to which corner.

## Project Status

Baldosa is under active development and will potentially face breaking changes constantly.
If you are interested in actively participating in this experiment at this stage, first it would be
much appreciated, but also beware of the risk of constant changes, loss of accounts, etc. Of course I will
try to help with any potential issues.

Baldosa's code is open source, and you can follow its development (or better yet, contribute to it) [on GitHub](https://github.com/loreanvictor/baldosa). Please also use GitHub as a place to report any issues.
